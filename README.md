#### Description:

My project can be split into 3 categories:
Authentication
Displaying the map with pins for every recycling spot
Form for adding new spots

To make the sign up /login/ reset password process faster I have used Firebase auth solution.
For displaying the map I have used the React Native Maps library and for selecting a new place I have used Google Places API.

I tried to follow best practices while creating the project. Every screen has its own folder and state is shared between shared thanks to Context API solution from React.

To set up the project faster, I have used Expo, a framework  that has tools and services built for React Native.

I have also used TypeScript to typecheck my screen and my variables. The illustrations are from https://www.freepik.com/, free to use with attribution.
